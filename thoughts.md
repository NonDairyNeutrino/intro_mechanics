# Thoughts
Many of these thoughts were taken from work done through the BETTER in STEM workshop of Summer 2024.
- Do a pre-course survey to ask about
	- their hobbies
	- their experiences
	- anything they think I should know
- Use hobbies as examples for in-class problems
	- pull from a "hat"?
- Start each day, activity, homework, etc with the how the content ties to the learning targets.
- Tie topics to important issues such as climate change
	- Students find relevant examples and post them in LMS discussions
- Each week, find a "hidden figure" (scientist whose significant work hasn't been widely known) to spotlight
- Tie topics to different cultures works in the matter e.g. Chinese astronomy
- Each week have students reflect on their own learning and understanding of that week's content
- ***Think-pair-share is a key component of everyday activity***

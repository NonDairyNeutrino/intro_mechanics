= Part I: Setting Sail

*Kinematics in 1 Dimension*  
The ship’s anchor is hoisted at a constant acceleration.  
+ Equation: $x = x_0 + v_0t + frac{1}{2}at^2$.  
   Substituting $x_0 = 0$, $v_0 = 0$, $x = 10.0 \, \text{m}$, and $t = 15 \, \text{s}$:  
   $10.0 = \frac{1}{2}a(15)^2$  
   $a = \frac{10.0}{\frac{1}{2}(15)^2} = 0.089 \, \text{m/s}^2$.  

+ To find velocity: $v = v_0 + at$.  
   $v = 0 + (0.089)(15) = 1.34 \, \text{m/s}$.

*Kinematics in 2 Dimensions*  
Horizontal motion: $v_x = 4.0 \, \text{m/s}$.  
Vertical motion: $v_{y0} = \sqrt{2gh} = \sqrt{2(9.8)(3.0)} = 7.67 \, \text{m/s}$.  

+ Time of flight: $t = \frac{2v_{y0}}{g} = \frac{2(7.67)}{9.8} = 1.57 \, \text{s}$.  

+ Horizontal displacement: $x = v_x t = (4.0)(1.57) = 6.28 \, \text{m}$.  

+ Trajectory shape: The pirate observes a parabolic path.

= Part II: Battle at Sea

*Force and Dynamics in 1 Dimension*  
+ Using $v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(x - x_0)$:  
   $25.0^2 = 0 + 2a(2.0)$  
   $a = \frac{25.0^2}{2(2.0)} = 156.25 \, \text{m/s}^2$.  

+ Average force: $F = ma = (10.0)(156.25) = 1562.5 \, \text{N}$.  

+ Cannon recoil force: $F = 1562.5 \, \text{N}$. Recoil acceleration: $a = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{1562.5}{200.0} = 7.81 \, \text{m/s}^2$.

*Newton’s Third Law*  
+ The force exerted by the HMS Kinematics on the rival ship is $500 \, \text{N}$.  

+ Explanation: Newton’s Third Law states that forces between two interacting bodies are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

= Part III: The Treasure Island

*Dynamics in 2 Dimensions*  
+ Horizontal force: $F_x = F \cos \theta = 200 \cos 30^\circ = 173.2 \, \text{N}$.  
  Vertical force: $F_y = F \sin \theta - F_g = 200 \sin 30^\circ - (50.0)(9.8) = -240.0 \, \text{N}$.  

+ Friction force: $F_f = \mu F_n = (0.1)(50.0 \cdot 9.8 + 200 \sin 30^\circ) = 54.0 \, \text{N}$.  

+ Net force: $F_{net} = F_x - F_f = 173.2 - 54.0 = 119.2 \, \text{N}$.  

+ Acceleration: $a = \frac{F_{net}}{m} = \frac{119.2}{50.0} = 2.38 \, \text{m/s}^2$.  

+ Distance: $x = v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2 = 0 + \frac{1}{2}(2.38)(10.0)^2 = 119.0 \, \text{m}$.  

---

*Impulse and Momentum*  
+ Final velocity: $p = mv$, $\Delta p = (1.0 + 3.0)v - (1.0)(6.0)$.  
   $\Delta p = 0 \implies (4.0)v = 6.0 \implies v = 1.5 \, \text{m/s}$.  

+ Average force: $\Delta p = F \Delta t$, $F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} = \frac{6.0 - (1.5 \cdot 4.0)}{0.5} = 12.0 \, \text{N}$.

= Part IV: The Treasure Haul

*Work and Kinetic Energy*  
+ Work: $W = Fd = (200)(5.0) = 1000 \, \text{J}$ for both chests.  

+ Change in kinetic energy: $W = \Delta KE$.  

+ Velocity: $KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$, solving gives $v_{50} = 6.32 \, \text{m/s}$ and $v_{70} = 5.35 \, \text{m/s}$.  

---

*Interactions and Potential Energy*  
+ $PE_g = mgh$. At $h = 2.0 \, \text{m}$: $PE = (30.0)(9.8)(2.0) = 588.0 \, \text{J}$.  

+ After falling 1.5 m: $PE = (30.0)(9.8)(0.5) = 147.0 \, \text{J}$.  

+ Spring energy: $U_s = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$, $x = \sqrt{\frac{2(441)}{500}} = 0.94 \, \text{m}$.

= Part V: Celebration!

*Energy Conservation*  
+ Speed: $KE = PE$, $\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = mgh$, $v = \sqrt{2gh} = 7.67 \, \text{m/s}$.  

+ With resistance: $KE - W = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$, solving gives $v = 7.49 \, \text{m/s}$.  

*Uniform Circular Motion*  
+ Speed: $v = \frac{2 \pi r}{T} = \frac{2 \pi (2.5)}{3.0} = 5.24 \, \text{m/s}$.  

+ Tension: $F = \frac{mv^2}{r} = \frac{(25.0)(5.24)^2}{2.5} = 274.3 \, \text{N}$.  

+ Max speed: Solving $\frac{(25.0)v^2}{2.5} = 500$ gives $v = 7.07 \, \text{m/s}$.

*Forces Approach*  
Horizontal and vertical forces govern motion; horizontal remains constant, vertical is affected by gravity.  

*Energy Approach*  
$KE + PE$ remains constant throughout trajectory. At highest point, max $PE$, min $KE$.

This practice exam is designed to prepare you for the actual final exam. Attempt all questions and show your work clearly. Use appropriate units where required. 

+ A ship starts from rest at a port and accelerates uniformly at $2.0 m/s^2$ for $5.0 s$.
  +  What is the ship's velocity after $5.0 s$?
  +  How far does the ship travel during this time?
  +  If the ship then decelerates uniformly at $-1.0 m/s^2$, how much time will it take to come to rest?

+ A pirate launches a cannonball with an initial speed of $20.0 m/s$ at an angle of $30 degree$ above the horizontal from a cliff $50.0 m$ high.
  +  How long is the cannonball in the air?
  +  How far horizontally does the cannonball travel before hitting the ground?
  +  What is the speed of the cannonball just before it strikes the ground?

+ A treasure chest with mass $50.0 "kg"$ is being dragged across a horizontal surface with a coefficient of kinetic friction $mu_k = 0.3$ by a rope exerting a force of $200.0 N$ at an angle of $30 degree$ above the horizontal.
  +  Calculate the frictional force acting on the chest.
  +  Find the net force acting on the chest.
  +  Determine the acceleration of the chest.

+ A pirate hoists a crate of mass $20.0 "kg"$ vertically upward using a pulley system. If the tension in the rope is $250.0 N$,  
  +  What is the net force on the crate?  
  +  What is the acceleration of the crate?  
  +  How much time does it take for the crate to reach a height of $10.0 m$ if it starts from rest?

+ Two ships are connected by a rope. Ship A has a mass of $2000 "kg"$, and Ship B has a mass of $1500 "kg"$. If Ship A exerts a force of $5000 N$ on the rope,  
  +  What is the force exerted by Ship B on the rope?  
  +  Calculate the acceleration of the system assuming no friction or resistance.  
  +  Determine the tension in the rope between the two ships.

+ A parrot with a mass of $1.5 "kg"$ is perched on a rope and is accelerating horizontally at $0.5 m/s^2$ while the rope makes a $45 degree$ angle with the vertical.
  +  Find the tension in the rope.  
  +  Calculate the horizontal component of the tension.  
  +  Determine the net force acting on the parrot.

+ A cannonball of mass $10.0 "kg"$ is fired with a speed of $50.0 m/s$. After striking a wall, it rebounds with a speed of $30.0 m/s$.
  +  What is the impulse imparted on the cannonball by the wall?  
  +  If the impact lasts $0.02 s$, calculate the average force exerted by the wall.  
  +  Discuss how the change in velocity affects the momentum of the cannonball.

+ Two treasure chests, one with mass $10.0 "kg"$ and the other with mass $20.0 "kg"$, are pushed across a horizontal deck with a force of $100.0 N$ each for a distance of $5.0 m$.  
  +  How much work is done on each chest?  
  +  What is the change in kinetic energy of each chest?  
  +  Which chest has a larger velocity after being pushed?  

+ A spring-loaded trap with a spring constant $k = 500.0 N/m$ is compressed by $0.2 m$.  
  +  Calculate the potential energy stored in the spring.  
  +  If the spring releases its energy to propel a $2.0 "kg"$ object horizontally, find the object's velocity.  
  +  Discuss how the spring force varies with compression.

+ A pirate slides down a ramp of height $5.0 m$ and length $10.0 m$. The ramp is frictionless.  
  +  Determine the pirate's speed at the bottom of the ramp.  
  +  If a frictional force of $30.0 N$ acts on the pirate, calculate their speed at the bottom.  
  +  Explain how friction affects the conservation of energy in this case.

// + *Extra Credit:* A cannon fires a cannonball of mass $5.0 "kg"$ at a $45 degree$ angle with an initial speed of $25.0 m/s$. Assuming no air resistance,  
//   +  Use forces to explain why the cannonball follows a parabolic path.  
//   +  Calculate the maximum height and total range of the cannonball.  
//   +  Discuss how energy conservation applies throughout the motion.
